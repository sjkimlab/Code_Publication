## About
This folder contains analysis code used in Kim et al on mRNA degradation in bacteria.

## FISH analysis
We provide three versions of FISH analysis code, depending on the need.

- 'FISHanalysis2' folder contains an example dataset to test plotting. The scripts were lightly modified to use these data files accordingly.
- 'FISHanalysis' folder is the original version without an example data set. This contains two additial script files that are used to 1) prepare raw files for oufti & uTrack analysis and 2) combine multiple analysis results, respectively
- A more complete workflow from handling raw image files can be found in 'FISH2025'.
