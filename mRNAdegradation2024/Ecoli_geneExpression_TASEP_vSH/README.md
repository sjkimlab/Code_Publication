# Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP

Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP is a matlab application created to simulate RNAP transcription and analyze the resulting simulated datasets. .

In order to run this program you must have either MATLAB installed or MATLAB Runtime installed. The MATLAB runtime does not require the user to have a MATLAB license.


## Using MATLAB runtime


In order to run the .exe you will need to have MATLAB runtime installed. This program is tested on MATLAB runtime R2023a(9.14). You can download and install this runtime from:

`https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html`

With the runtime is installed, you should be able to run the file `Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP_dataViewer.exe`

## Using MATLAB App designer

Alternatively you can open the .mlapp in MATLAB app designer and run it through the app designer. The .mlapp file can be found in the following repository:
`\uncompiledCode\Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP_dataViewer.mlapp`

the .mlapp requires the following file to be in the same directory:
`Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP_function.m`


## Running the code
A more detailed guide to help use the simulation GUI can be found under the name: `Readme for Ecoli_geneExpression_TASEP.pdf`
Due to the space limitation in Github, we were not able to provide datasets.
The complete version with the data sets can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17970097) repository.
