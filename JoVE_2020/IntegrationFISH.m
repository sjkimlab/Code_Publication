function intP = IntegrationFISH(rawFISHdata,mRNAlifetime)
%{
-About-
This function calculates the total mRNAs made from pulsed induction. The calculation follows eq 3 in SI of Kim, et al. LacZ paper.
It is to estimate premature termination between two probe regions.

-Inputs-
rawFISHdata:  three column data. First column = time points (minutes),
second column = Z5 signal, and third column = Z3 signal.
mRNAlifetime:  mean mRNA lifetimes (minutes), obtained by fitting an exponential decay function to the last 4-6 data points in the pulsed induction curve (i.e. t ~ 6-12 min)

-varargin-

-Outputs-
output:     total lacZ mRNAs (Z5 and Z3) made until each time point (first
column of rawFISHdata)

-Example-
rawFISHdata =
